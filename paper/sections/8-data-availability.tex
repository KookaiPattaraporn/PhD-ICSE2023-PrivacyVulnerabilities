A full replication package containing all the artifacts and data produced by our study is made publicly available at \url{https://figshare.com/articles/conference_contribution/icse2023-paper908-replication-pkg/21922731} or DOI: \url{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21922731}. There are five folders in the package: i) accepted-paper, ii) code, iii) common-weakness-proposal, iv) data and v) taxonomy. The \textbf{README} file that explains relevant folders and files is also included in the replication package.
