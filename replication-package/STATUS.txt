We aim to apply for the Artifact Available badge. 

We publicly provided the research artifacts which include all relevant data and outputs produced from every key process in the paper in the replication package named \textbf{``icse2023-paper908-replication-pkg'' }. Those key processes are i) the identification of privacy-related CWE and CVE, ii) the explanatory study on existing privacy software engineering research, well-established data protection regulations and privacy frameworks and additional reputable industry resources, iii) the development of a taxonomy of common privacy threats, iv) the investigation of privacy threats covered in CWE and CVE and v) the proposal of new common privacy weaknesses. This is to ensure transparency and availability of our approaches and processes in our study. The research community can also verify the outputs generated from our processes. In addition, the research community can follow our approaches in other interesting research directions when needed. We believe that these artifacts can also be used to initiate discussions and further work in the community (e.g. new common privacy weaknesses).
